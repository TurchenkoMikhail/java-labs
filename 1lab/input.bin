John and I have lived at our present home almost sixteen years and have had at least twelve thousand guests tor dinner. Itâ€™s not something I wish to brag about. It is something I have been privileged to do. 
From family dinners and festive occasions to bridal showers and wedding receptions, we have enjoyed them tremendously. 
The number of people at these occasions has ranged from one to three hundred at a time. Our goal has always been to make people feel welcomed when they arrive and satisfied when they leave.
